# Dashboard that shows [carbon-c-relay](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay) statistics.

## Usage and prefix
There is no need for any configuration, since carbon-c-relay is sending it's statistics by default. Default prefix is `carbon.relays.<hostname>.*`
Dashboard is as generic as possible and I tried to use variables where possible.

## Metrics explained
There is a link on the top right corner, that takes you carbon-c-relay github repo where all metrics are explained in details.

## ChangeLog
* Rev 2: Replace dispatchers state graph with dispatchers busyness
* Rev 1: Initial upload

## Make it better
For all ideas and ways to make it better, please open an issue and I'll do my best to make it better: https://github.com/matejzero/grafana-dashboards
