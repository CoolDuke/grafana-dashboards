# Grafana dashboards for measuring MySQL performance with Graphite

These are Grafana dashboards for MySQL to be used with Graphite. They are based on great [Percona dashboards for Prometheus](https://github.com/percona/grafana-dashboards). I try to mimic them as close as possible.

Currently, the following dashboards are available:

* MySQL InnoDB Metrics
* MySQL MyISAM Metrics
* MySQL Overview
* MySQL Replication

## Usage and prefix
These dashboards are meant to be used with CollectD as a metrics collector. Provided *mysql.py CollectD plugin* must be used to gather statistics and put them in the right prefix.

Default prefix in dashboards is **servers**.

### Collectd configuration
If you donâ€™t already have the Python module loaded, you need to configure it first:

    <LoadPlugin python>
        Globals true
    </LoadPlugin>
    <Plugin python>
        ModulePath "/path/to/python/modules"
    </Plugin>

You should then configure the MySQL plugin:

    <Plugin python>
        Import mysql
        <Module mysql>
            Host "localhost" (default: localhost)
            Port 3306 (default: 3306)
            User "root" (default: root)
            Password "xxxx" (default: empty)
            HeartbeatTable "percona.heartbeat" (if using pt-heartbeat to track slave lag)
            Verbose false (default: false)
        </Module>
    </Python>


There is also a **host** variable which is set to *sql** by default(I might remove that in the future). If your server has different name, [change](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/templating/) is accordingly.

## Metrics explained
There is a link on the top right corner, that takes you carbon-c-relay github repo where all metrics are explained in details.
